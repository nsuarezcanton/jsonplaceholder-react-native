## Issues

### Detox

#### iOS

Make sure if you want to make use of detox to follow the [getting started](https://github.com/wix/detox/blob/master/docs/Introduction.GettingStarted.md) and install the prerequisites and dependencies needed.

#### Android

Currently doesn't work out of the box, so there is a little set up needed in the android project itself. So you will need to follow a seperate [getting started](https://github.com/wix/detox/blob/master/docs/Introduction.Android.md) guide in order to setup detox for android.

Make sure to amend the configurations of the detox config appropriately to match the correct emulator you've selected.
